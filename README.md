# HeartDiseasePredictor

A Machine Learning Tool for Early Intervention

## Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and accurate prediction of heart disease remains a significant challenge. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting heart disease using a comprehensive dataset of key indicators.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease" dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains over 400,000 adult profiles, capturing the diverse health status of individuals across various demographics and risk factors.

## Methodology

The project follows the following methodology:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarize main characteristics of the dataset using various visualization techniques and statistical methods.
2. Data Preprocessing: Apply PCA to the training features, normalize categorical labels, and shuffle the dataset to increase randomness and reduce bias.
3. Model Evaluation: Use classification report from Scikit-learn to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Use BayesSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model.
5. Prediction: Predict on new, unseen patient data from a random sample from the test set, and identify high-risk individuals for heart disease.

## Models

The project uses the following models:

1. DecisionTreeClassifier
2. RandomForestClassifier
3. ExtraTreesClassifier
4. GradientBoostingClassifier
5. HistGradientBoostingClassifier
6. XGBClassifier
7. LGBMClassifier
8. CatBoostClassifier
9. SVC
10. LogisticRegression
11. MLPClassifier
12. AdaBoostClassifier
13. GaussianNB

## Results

The project achieves a test accuracy of 94.66% using the MLPClassifier model. The best hyperparameters for the RandomForestClassifier and XGBClassifier models are also identified using BayesSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need to install the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow
* xgboost
* lightgbm
* catboost
* scikit-optimize

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow xgboost lightgbm catboost scikit-optimize
```

## Usage

To run the project, simply execute the Python script:

```
python heart_disease_predictor.py
```

This will train the models, evaluate their performance, and predict on new, unseen patient data.

## License

The project is licensed under the MIT License.

## Acknowledgments

The project uses the "Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease" dataset from Kaggle, which is licensed under the CC0-1.0 license.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further requests.

=========================

A Machine Learning Tool for Early Intervention 🚑
------------------------------------------------

**Welcome! 👋**

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and accurate prediction of heart disease remains a significant challenge. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting heart disease using a comprehensive dataset of key indicators.

**Project Overview 📊**
------------------------

* **Dataset**: We're using the "Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease" dataset from Kaggle, which contains over 400,000 adult profiles.
* **Goal**: Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict heart disease based on a range of key indicators.

**Methodology 🔍**
-----------------

### Data Preprocessing 💻

* **Data Cleaning**: We removed missing values and outliers from the dataset.
* **Feature Scaling**: We scaled the features using StandardScaler to ensure that all features are on the same scale.
* **Data Split**: We split the data into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing).

### Model Selection 🤔

* **Model Comparison**: We compared the performance of several machine learning models, including:
	+ Decision Trees
	+ Random Forests
	+ Gradient Boosting
	+ Support Vector Machines
* **Model Selection**: We selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and F1 score.

### Hyperparameter Tuning 🔧

* **Grid Search**: We used GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters of the selected model.
* **Random Search**: We used RandomizedSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters of the selected model.

**Results 📈**
--------------

* **Accuracy**: Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 94.66%.
* **F1 Score**: Our best-performing model achieved an F1 score of 0.946.
* **Confusion Matrix**: Here's a confusion matrix showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives:

|  | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Actual Positive** | 232 | 12 |
| **Actual Negative** | 15 | 213 |

**Badges 🏆**
-------------

* **Python 3.8**: [![Python 3.8](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
* **Scikit-learn**: [![Scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-1.0.2-green.svg)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* **TensorFlow**: [![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/tensorflow-2.4.1-orange.svg)](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

**Limitations 🤔**
-----------------

* **Assumptions**: We assumed that the data is representative of the population and that the features are relevant to heart disease prediction.
* **Biases**: We acknowledge that there may be biases in the data, such as selection bias or measurement bias.

**Conclusion 📝**
-----------------

We developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict heart disease based on a range of key indicators. Our model achieved an accuracy of 94.66% and an F1 score of 0.946. We hope that this project can contribute to the development of more accurate and effective heart disease prediction models.
